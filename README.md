# Pregait

Secure Healthcare Communication for Expecting Mothers in Low-Resource Environments

---

## ✨ Inspiration

Pregait was born from a deeply personal journey. Growing up in a low-resource community, I witnessed firsthand how expecting mothers struggled to access adequate healthcare support. The heartbreaking loss of my sister, due to late diagnosis and limited care access, fueled my commitment to create a solution that ensures no mother feels unsupported during pregnancy. **Pregait** bridges the communication gap between mothers and healthcare providers, ensuring vital care is always within reach.

## 🚀 What It Does

**Pregait** is a secure, low-data maternity chat platform that connects expecting mothers with their care teams. Key features include:

- 🗣️ **Direct and Group Chats** for seamless communication.
- 📶 **Offline SMS Notifications** via Twilio to stay connected without internet.
- 😀 **Built-in Emojis and GIFs** to enrich conversations.
- ✏️ **Message Editing and Deletion** for clarity and control.

Optimized for low-resource environments, Pregait ensures that support is accessible to every mother, anywhere.
