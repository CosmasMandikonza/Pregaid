# Pregait

Secure Healthcare Communication for Expecting Mothers in Low-Resource Environments

---

## ✨ Inspiration

Pregait was born from a deeply personal journey. Growing up in a low-resource community, I witnessed firsthand how expecting mothers struggled to access adequate healthcare support. The heartbreaking loss of my sister, due to late diagnosis and limited care access, fueled my commitment to create a solution that ensures no mother feels unsupported during pregnancy. **Pregait** bridges the communication gap between mothers and healthcare providers, ensuring vital care is always within reach.
